# Space Invaders Project

This is a small Game project I started during highschool and the first year of university. It is somehat a combination of the classic Arcade Games 'Space Invaders' and 'Asteroids'

## Elements
- Mainship: This is your Spacecraft, you can fly up and down and strafe left and right with WASD. Shift accellerates the speed, Ctrl slows it down
- Enemyships: Enemyships fly down the screen at a constant speed and shoot in a constant interval. If you get shot or crash into them, You'll lose.
- Comets: Comets fall down with a randomized angle and speed. If you shoot them or it crashes with an Enemyship, it splits into two smaller comets which then get destroied if either happens to them again.

## Features
This game supports a scoring system and stores the Top 10 Scores to incentives you to get higher scores
